## Hello World from @nsquare !
## 

Hi there !

My name is Nilpa Jha. Currently I am working as an ML/NLP engineer at Accenture. My work includes working on tons of unstructured messy data and make data products on top of it to either automate the process or use that in predictive data modelling. I am a pythonist who is also proficient in R. My interest area are :

- Machine learning ( fav : random forest and matrix factorization)
- Text summarization and text classification
- Deep learning for NLP problems : Yes have got my hands dirty with it for text classification and semantic similarity problems.

Other interests which I'd like to pursue 

- Data Visualization using D3 , totally a [Mike Bostock](https://github.com/mbostock) fan. I want to fill this world with beautiful interactive charts !
- Chatbots. Trying to add brain to my chatbot using AIML framework so that someday it can be brainy enough to reply my chats while I am sleeping. -_-
- Differential Equations (or applied Maths in general): Thinking Euler's way 
- Kaggle : Please someone collaborate with me, else I'll keep missing merger deadlines.
- Colors and Paintings! Probably source of my love for datavis. I do watercolor paintings and you can check out that on [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/pagal_ladkii/).

If you want to catch-up with me with any of the above ideas, drop me an email on `nilpajha@gmail.com` or check the bar on the left for more !

Thanks for passing by.
