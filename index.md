## Hello World from @nsquare !


Hi there !

My name is Nilpa Jha. Currently I am working as Senior Data Scientist (Visual Intelligence at Ikea). Previously I had worked at Myntra.com to build AI applications, GAN generated design and curation for fashion-Tech. Check out [here](http://www.livemint.com/Companies/tchtq74FOkMM43szMIHh0M/At-Myntra-machines-tell-designers-how-to-make-clothes.html) about the cool things our team was working on!

My interest Area are:

- Object detection and segmentation.
- Explainable AI
- Ethics in AI
- Generating Art using GANs

Other interests which I'd like to pursue 

- **Data Visualization using D3** :  totally a [Mike Bostock](https://github.com/mbostock) fan. I want to fill this world with beautiful interactive charts !
- **Network Analysis** : Someday I'll finish that Lada Adamic course..
- **Hackathons** Always up for pouring code for side projects and hackathon.(Interested Folks, please drop me an email and drag me in). Previously won Pan-IIT Hackathon, Rakuten Image classification challenge and Finalist at International Data Analytics Olympiad.
- **Watercolor and Piano**: Probably source of my love for datavis. I do watercolor paintings and you can check out that on [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/pagal_ladkii/). Piano samples not available in public interest. :P

If you want to catch-up with me with any of the above ideas, drop me an email on `nilpajha@gmail.com` or check the bar on the left for more !

Thanks for passing by.
